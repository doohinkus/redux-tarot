## 3 Card Marseille Tarot Spread

This app lets you choose three cards from the Marsielle deck. Once cards are selected, you can flip them over to discover what they mean. The first card represents the past, the second the present, and the third the outcome or future.

This project is still in development.

Here is a link to a MVP demo.
